        <p>
          You can't buy happiness, but you can buy a bike, and that's pretty
          close. We offer a wide range of exciting self-guided bicycle
          adventures - in the mountains, by the fjords, and along the coast.
          Steep hills won’t take your breath away - the spectacular nature will.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our bicycle tours are designed for people wanting to cycle around
          Italy - but, eco friendly. The daily stages are moderate, and all
          trips include luggage transfer.
        </p>

          <p class="guestText">
            „We did the Adventure Tour not knowing what to expect, with our
            children being 13 and 15 years old. It couldn't have been better!
            What an experience! The team really took care of us, and made
            amazing food. The bmx competition was a big hit with the kids, they
            even won prices. Thank you so much.”
